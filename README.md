How InstructLab helps enhance LLMs

InstructLab is an open-source AI project, developed by IBM and Red Hat, that is designed to enhance LLMs through community contributions. It streamlines the process of training LLMs by facilitating the submission of skills and knowledge from the community.

InstructLab uses a combination of these processes:

    Taxonomy-driven data curation
    Large-scale synthetic data generation
    A multi-phased instruction-tuning method

Letâ€™s examine the InstructLab approach carefully, breaking it down step by step.
